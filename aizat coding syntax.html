      <p>I am Muhammad Aizat Bin Ahmad Fauzi who is currently in the final semester
 in the Information Management course.I am from Bagan Serai, Perak. I was born on January 21, 2001. I am one of the students who is currently studying at UITM Sungai Petani branch, Kedah.My hobby in my spare time is to do something quiet but fun like watching a movie.My favorite food is all my mom’s cooking because my mom’s cooking is all delicious.I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.My parents are outgoing people and they are quite down to earth. I get lots of attention from both of my parents, my grandparents, their friends and basically everyone around me. This probably explains why I crave attention wherever I go and I only associate with people who show me care and attention.
I love meeting people and I love making friends with people who are social. I am who I am, and I make no excuses for how I have turned out.</center>

<h2>My Parent & My Brother</h2>
<h3>The word “family” conjures up a series of images and emotions. Many times we can look at family with feelings of warmth, love, happiness, and safety. Just as many times, however, family can bring up pain and frustration and flat out trauma. Families are as complicated as the individuals that make them up.</h3>

<h2>My friends or can I say my second family</h2>
<br>
<h3>A family is like a circle.
The connection never ends,
and even if at times it breaks,
in time it always mends.
<br>

A family is like the stars.
Somehow they’re always there.
Families are those who help,
who support and always care.
<br>
A family is like a book.
The ending’s never clear,
but through the pages of the book,
their love is always near.
<br>
A family is many things.
With endless words that show
who they are and what they do
and how they teach you so you know.
<br>
But don’t be weary if it’s broken
or if through time it’s been so worn.
Families are like that—
they’re split up and always torn.

But even if this happens,
your family will always be.
They help define just who you are
and will be a part of you eternally.</h3>
